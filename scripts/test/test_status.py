    The layer repository maps its `mapped/` subsection (`top.txt`, `keep/k.txt`,
    `drop/d.txt`) at a differently named `lay/`, while `outside/` and
    `loose.txt` stay unmapped. The whole-repo count is `root.txt` plus the `lay`
    mount and the mapped subtree — 3 directories, 4 files — never the unmapped
    entries. `--count lay` counts just the layer (3/3), `--count lay/keep` just
    that subtree (1/1), `--count root.txt` just the parent file (0/1), and a
    view filter excluding `lay/drop/` drops that part of the mapped content
    (2/3), proving the filter matches the target mount path, not the source.
